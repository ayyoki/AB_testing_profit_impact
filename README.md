# A/B Testing to Assess Profit Impact

## Overview
The site launched an A/B test to increase income. Our objective is to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean 'Revenue' between the control and variant groups.

## Development Environment
- **Platform**: Google Collaboratory

## Libraries Used

### Data Pre-Processing and Analysis
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scipy
- typing

### Testing
- `scipy.stats.shapiro`
- `scipy.stats.levene`
- `scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu`

## Dataset Introduction
- **Source**: Provided by a real bank (name withheld)
- **Description**: Each row in the dataset represents the revenue generated by a user.
- **Size**: 
  - Training dataset: 10,000 rows and 3 columns

## Project Steps
1. **Separating Groups**: Dividing data into control and variant groups.
2. **Removing Duplicates**: Ensuring data cleanliness by removing any duplicate entries.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualizations and summary statistics.
4. **Handling Outliers**: Identifying and managing outliers to prevent skewed results.
5. **Assumption Checks**:
   - Normal Distribution: Using the Shapiro-Wilk test.
   - Variance Homogeneity: Using Levene's test.
6. **Hypothesis Testing**: Applying the Mann-Whitney U Test to compare the groups.

## Results and Metrics
The test results indicated the following:
- **U-statistic**: 2,918,515.0
- **P-value**: 0.259
- **Conclusion**: We fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating no significant difference in revenue between the control and variant groups.
